# Mall Customer Segmentation

## Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques, specifically K-means and Hierarchical Clustering, to segment customers into meaningful groups based on their demographic and spending behavior.

## Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization of customer demographics and spending patterns.
- **Clustering Models**: Implementation of K-means and Hierarchical Clustering.
- **Results and Insights**: Actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

## How to Run
